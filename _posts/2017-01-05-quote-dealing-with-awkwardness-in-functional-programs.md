As you write more functional programs, you'll sometimes encounter
situations like this where the functional way of expressing a program
feels awkward or tedious. Does this imply that purity is the
equivalent of trying to write an entire novel without using the letter
E? Of course not. Awkwardness like this is almost always a sign of
some missing abstraction waiting to be discovered. When you encounter
these situations, we encourage you to plow ahead and look for common
patterns that you can factor out. Most likely, this is a problem that
others have encountered, and you may even rediscover the "standard"
solution yourself. Even if you get stuck, struggling to puzzle out a
clean solution yourself will help you to better understand what
solutions others have discovered to deal with similar problems. With
practice, experience, and more familiarity with the idioms contained
in this book, expressing a program functionally will become effortless
and natural. Of course, good design is still hard, but programming
using pure functions greatly simplifies the design space.
