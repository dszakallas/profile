programmer, software & data engineer located in Budapest. I received an M.Sc. degree in 2018 from Budapest University of Technology and Engineering, specializing in fault tolerant systems. Recently, I worked at [Ekata](https://ekata.com/) as a Big Data Engineer.

**Currently I am looking for new opportunities.**

## Experience

- Apache Spark & Databricks: I spent two years at Ekata refactoring and optimizing a complicated 30,000 SLOC Spark application.
- AWS cloud: S3, EMR, Redshift.
- Containerization and microservices using Kubernetes
- Apache Airflow
- JVM languages  (Java, Scala, Kotlin & Groovy)
- Python 3, Node.js, Bash/Linux
- git, GitHub, CircleCI, Jenkins CI
- Knowledge in RDBMS and NoSQL technologies
- Functional programming in Scala, using cats & shapeless
- Some experience in developing supervised ML pipelines
- Working in a cross-functional team of data engineers and data scientists

## Things I am interested in

- Privacy and anonymization in the face of Big Data and Machine Learning
- Data lineage tracking
- Incremental stream processing

## Tech
Technologies I prefer:
- Languages: Scala (Dotty ðŸ˜Š), Python, Rust, Javascript
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure or GCP
- Browser: ðŸ”¥ðŸ¦Š

I have some knowledge of data analytics toolkits in R (data.table, ggplot, shiny) and Python (numpy, pandas).

## Social media
[@szdavid92](https://twitter.com/szdavid92) mostly tweets about tech,
free software and privacy, seldom politics in EU and Hungary. I sometimes like, but **don't** retweet memes.
