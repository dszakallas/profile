you found yourself on the homepage of Szak치llas D치vid,
a programmer, hacker and nice guy from Budapest, Hungary, Europe. I am
specializing in backend development and data engineering. I recently received
an M.Sc. degree from BME, one of the region's prominent technological universities,
where I learned about fault-tolerant systems, distributed computing and databases.
Currently I am working as a software engineer on data related things at [Whitepages](https://www.whitepages.com/).
By night I hack around MIDI gadgets 游꿑 游꿐 or play the guitar.

## Experience

- Deep knowledge of running and optimizing Spark workloads, knowledge of Spark internals
- General knowledge of the Big Data landscape

## Tech
Technologies I prefer:
- Languages: Scala, Python, Javascript, Rust, Go, SQL
