  en: 👋 Hey there visitor,
key: page-about
---

you found yourself on the homepage of Szakállas Dávid,
a programmer, hacker and nice guy from Budapest, Hungary, Europe. I am
specializing in backend development and data engineering. I recently received
an M.Sc. degree from BME, one of the region's prominent technological universities,
where I learned about fault-tolerant systems, distributed computing and databases.
Currently I am working as a software engineer on data related things at [Whitepages](https://www.whitepages.com/).
By night I hack around MIDI gadgets 🎛 🎚 or play the guitar.

## Experience

- Deep knowledge of running and optimizing Spark workloads, knowledge of Spark internals
- General knowledge of the Big Data landscape
- Working knowledge of AWS S3, EMR, EC2
- Experience working in a dockerized environment and deploying to Kubernetes
- Good knowledge of Airflow

## Tech
Technologies I prefer:
- Languages: Scala, Python, Javascript, Rust, Go, SQL
- Processing: Spark, Kafka, Node.js, Airflow
- Databases: Redis, Elastic, Postgres
- Infrastructure: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes

I have some knowledge of data analytics toolkits in R (data.table, ggplot, shiny) and Python (numpy, pandas).
