  en: 👋 Hey there visitor,
key: page-about
---

you found yourself on the homepage of Szakállas Dávid,
a programmer, hacker and nice guy from Budapest, Hungary, Europe. I am
specializing in backend development and data engineering. I recently received
an M.Sc. degree from BME, one of the region's prominent technological universities,
where I learned about fault-tolerant systems, distributed computing and databases.
Currently I am working as a software engineer on data related things at [Whitepages](https://www.whitepages.com/).
By night I hack around MIDI gadgets 🎛 🎚 or play the guitar.

## Tech
Here are the technologies I am generally good at or prefer to use:
- Programming languages: Scala, C/C++, JavaScript, Python, Rust
- Platforms: Apache Spark, JVM, Node.js, OSS (No)SQL DBs
- Infrastructure: Linux, Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, AWS
- Editors: Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ

I don't like these:
- Programming languages: Java, Groovy, PHP (even though I don't know it)
- Platforms: EJB, in-house proprietary platforms
- Infrastructure: proprietary DBs, Azure or Bluemix

I have some knowledge of data analytics toolkits in R (data.table, ggplot, shiny) and Python (numpy, pandas).

## Social media
[@szdavid92](https://twitter.com/szdavid92) mostly tweets about tech,
free software and privacy, seldom politics in EU and Hungary. I sometimes like, but **don't** retweet memes.

## Other
I am not an academic person.
- Here's my single page, printer friendly [CV](https://dszakallas.github.io/cv/david_szakallas.pdf)
- My [M.Sc. Thesis](https://dszakallas.github.io/thesis-msc-17/thesis.pdf)
