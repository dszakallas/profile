  en: 👋 Hey there visitor,
key: page-about
---

you found yourself on the homepage of Szakállas Dávid,
a programmer, hacker and nice guy from Budapest, Hungary, Europe. I am
specializing in data engineering. I received an M.Sc. degree in 2018 from Budapest 
University of Technology and Engineering, where I learned about fault-tolerant systems,
and distributed computing. I worked at [Ekata](https://ekata.com/) recently.

**Currently I am looking for new opportunities.**

## Experience

- Knowledge of developing and and tuning Spark workloads. I spent two years
at Ekata refactoring and optimizing a complicated 30,000 SLOC Spark application.
- Working knowledge of AWS cloud technologies such as S3, EMR, EC2.
- General knowledge of distributed columnar stores and key-value store databases 
- Experience working in a dockerized environment and Kubernetes
- Good knowledge of Airflow
- Some experience in machine learning
- Functional programming
- Working in a cross-functional team of data engineers and data scientists

## Things I am interested in

- Privacy and anonymization in the face of Big Data and Machine Learning
- Data lineage tracking
- Incremental stream processing

## Tech
Technologies I prefer:
- Languages: Scala (Dotty 😊), Python, Rust, Javascript
- Editor: Spacemacs, IntelliJ, Vim
- Tools: Bash, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes
- Browser: 🔥🦊

I have some knowledge of data analytics toolkits in R (data.table, ggplot, shiny) and Python (numpy, pandas).

## Social media
[@szdavid92](https://twitter.com/szdavid92) mostly tweets about tech,
free software and privacy, seldom politics in EU and Hungary. I sometimes like, but **don't** retweet memes.

## Other
- Here's my single page, printer friendly [CV](https://dszakallas.github.io/cv/david_szakallas.pdf)
- My [M.Sc. Thesis](https://dszakallas.github.io/thesis-msc-17/thesis.pdf)
- This blog is running on AWS. [dszakallas/profile-terraform](dszakallas/profile-terraform) is the config used to pull up the infrastructure. The site is generated with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the wonderful [kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme).
